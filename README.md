# Hello there! 👋

## About Me

Full-stack developer who speaks fluent JavaScript (and occasionally argues with CSS).

Building things with React, Node.js, and a healthy dose of anxiety. I make APIs that actually work and UIs that don't make users cry.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React + Vite
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Authentication: bcrypt + JWT

**Tools & Others**
- Git & GitHub
- Puppeteer (for when websites refuse to share nicely)
- Cloudinary

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- Clean code
- Proper authentication
- Git commits that make sense at 3 AM

## Current Status

Currently turning ideas into deployed applications and pretending I enjoy debugging.

## Let's Connect

Always up for collaborating on projects that solve real problems (or just cool stuff that makes the internet a better place).
